Introduction
============

The goal of SciSwitch is to allow for data conversion of datatypes commonly used with scientific research. The initial goal will include a few initial conversion tools, a suggestion page for heavily used data-types, and an implementation of [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) to allow for the use of converters written in many languages.
